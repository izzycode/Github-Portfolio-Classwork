#Let’s practice our method writing syntax! Prepare a method say_hello that takes one argument. That argument is the name of the person to be greeted. The method should then print on the screen a greeting to that person. For example:

#say_hello('Jack')
#=> "Why, hello there Jack!"
#Note: The there is no instant feedback for this question other than verification that your code doesn’t raise errors.


def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hi there #{name}"
end
